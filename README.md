# Data visualization competition

This repository contains data for the data visualization contest at Reed College in Fall 2020.  The `data` folder contains multiple csv files which can be used for the data visualization contest. The `example_ggplot.Rmd` file contains an example of using `ggplot2` and an extension (`ggrepel`) with the data.
